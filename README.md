# hello-world
My first Repository on Github
I have done Masters in Industrial Engineering from Arizona State University. I have more than 3 years of experience working as Business Intelligence Engineer. I have developed lot of data pipelines using SQL and have built complex SQL queries to perform complex transformation and extraction. I have also built optimization and statistical models using python. I am planning to put all of my favorite past SQL, python and R codes on Github.
